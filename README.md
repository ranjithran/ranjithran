# Hi There 👋

Welcome to my GitHub—where I break things so you don’t have to.  
(Okay, maybe I still do, but at least it’s entertaining.)

- 🔭  Currently working on something revolutionary (or just another bug fix, who knows? 🙃)  
- 🌱  Learning something that will be outdated next week ✌️
- 💬  Ask me about Flutter, JS, Spring, SalesForce, or anything else—except AI, because I like my sanity. 😎
